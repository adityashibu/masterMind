@ This ARM Assembler code should implement a matching function, for use in the MasterMind program, as
@ described in the CW2 specification. It should produce as output 2 numbers, the first for the
@ exact matches (peg of right colour and in right position) and approximate matches (peg of right
@ color but not in right position). Make sure to count each peg just once!
	
@ Example (first sequence is secret, second sequence is guess):
@ 1 2 1
@ 3 1 3 ==> 0 1
@ You can return the result as a pointer to two numbers, or two values
@ encoded within one number
